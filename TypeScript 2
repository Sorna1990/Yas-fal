**Refining Mobile Deployment Plan**

I'm now refining the mobile adaptation strategy, considering GitHub's role and the target of wrapping the application in a WebView. The goal is to provide a deployable version. I also want to make sure the build is straightforward and I am considering eliminating the PWA files.

\n\nI am modifying the source to reflect your specified branding updates. I have changed the relevant file content, which include changes to `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `src/app.component.ts`, and `src/manifest.webmanifest`. These files, containing the application's branding, are provided.
```json
```json
{
  "name": "فال یس اپلیکیشن",
  "description": "A mystical panel for exploring mythology, numerology, and inner archetypes through AI-powered insights.",
  "requestFramePermissions": []
}
